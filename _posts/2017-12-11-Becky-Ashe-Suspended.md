What happened to Becky Ashe and Timothy Childers? We aren't sure yet. However, we have ruled some explanations out, and here we provide facts and research about the incident. We are surprised about the lack of transparency (which is held as one of the tenets of any honest system) from KCS and the effort to keep people in the dark. Let this article serve as an illumination.


Alright, most students have probably heard that [Mrs. Ashe was suspended](http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2017/12/12/l-n-stem-academy-principals-placed-leave-knox-county-schools/943528001/). See that link for a good start to the story. However, we, as students, have a bit more info we thought we'd share. Gregory Croisdale, and other sources, have compiled a list of facts and timeline leading up to current day. We will continue to update the article as more information comes in.

Here's a document with all of our research, theories, facts, etc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xsokLYTHIqGNZErfLChuRFp38wUhe60og_pA5WK4onk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xsokLYTHIqGNZErfLChuRFp38wUhe60og_pA5WK4onk/edit?usp=sharing).

# Actual Timeline

Firstly, the implication from the official email and other news sources is that:

> as of today [December 11th], Ms. Laura Boring assumed administrative duties at L&N STEM following a decision to place Principal Becky Ashe and Vice Principal Tim Childers on leave

But, Ashe and Childers had actually been out since sometime during the day December 7th, here were when the "Daily Mission Briefing" emails were posted:

  * Mission Briefing 12-7 was posted by Becky Ashe on Wed **12/6**, 10:20 PM
 * Mission Briefing 12-8 was posted by Kristi Phillips on Fri **12/8**, 1:21 AM


(a note to those who are not familiar: sometimes the daily mission briefing is posted the night before, so that students can have a head start. The early morning post time by Kristi Phillips suggests that a sudden and abrupt suspension prevented Ashe from posting it)

> Knoxville Police Department Spokesman Darrell DeBusk said the department is aware of an investigation at Knox County Schools involving the two administrators at L&N. He would not say whether KPD is also investigating. He declined to release any further details. [http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2017/12/12/l-n-stem-academy-principals-placed-leave-knox-county-schools/943528001/](http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2017/12/12/l-n-stem-academy-principals-placed-leave-knox-county-schools/943528001/)

> Tennessee Department of Children Services spokesman Rob Johnson said something similar: "While DCS is aware of the circumstances surrounding the situation, the department is not conducting an investigation of the school at this time," Johnson said late Tuesday[http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2017/12/12/l-n-stem-academy-principals-placed-leave-knox-county-schools/943528001/](http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2017/12/12/l-n-stem-academy-principals-placed-leave-knox-county-schools/943528001/)

Furthermore, both Mr. Childers and Ms. Ashe were absent from the Orchestral Concert on Fri 12/8, and the Choral Concert on 12/7.

Based on this information, we can conclude that Mrs. Ashe (and Mr. Childers) were removed sometime during Thursday 12/7 between 12:00 in the morning and 4:30 PM (because they were not present at the Choral concert). For some reason, the email was sent on the 11th, even though the decision had already been made before that.



# What Happened?

Well, the school board gave no reason for the termination, and neither Becky Ashe or Tim Childers could be reached for comment, and they had not tweeted anything relevant (although they do have some interesting tweets, which we will go over later). The KPD confirmed that there was an ongoing investigation, but also gave no further details.

Here are some common theories. DISCLAIMER: these are not accusations, nor foolproof, and they are not proven. **Do not regard these as facts.** However, we are also not publishing any theories which have been disproven. Any of these which become disproven will be discarded.



## Unproven Theories

  * Ashe and Childers were smudging test grades or allowing cheating. The motivation would be for more school grants, and to maintain our high status as a high scoring school. Previous case: ["We found that the L&N STEM Academy was not in alignment with our district procedures regarding administering the local assessment required for recovery credit courses"](http://archive.knoxnews.com/news/former-stem-student-alleges-cheating-ep-510399095-355471961.html/).
  * Some sort of public funds mishap (possibly unintentional), wherein the adminstrators improperly used funds for some use.
  * DCS (since they have released a statement on the issue) may have had a case mishandled and/or improperly handled or cared for a student who was placed under control of a foster parent.


## Discredited Theories
 
  * Sexual Assault/Misconduct. We have talked to a teacher (who wishes to stay anonymous) who confirmed it was "nothing like that", and we are glad to rule that out
  * Affair/relationship. No evidence where we would expect it, and no good reason (most people said this as an unfunny joke).
  * False allegation. It would have been sorted out, and the amount of authorities involved makes it unlikely that a kid made up allegations against them.


Beware of those who claim to know the truth, but don't! We don't know what happened for sure, but we are trying to rule out things, and provide additional info for you to understand.
